# WP-Engine-Clock-Tweak
A simple script to replace wallpaper engine's default 12hr clock format to not include 0s in front of times &lt; 10:00/

Very bare bones. May be updated with other tools in the future but probably won't. Absolutely no warranty.

To use, go to a clock module in the editor -> text -> edit script, and then just delete the default and paste this in.
